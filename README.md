# Factor-Analysis-on-THE-DELL-Employee-Satisfaction-and-Engagement
Description:

This project aims to conduct a Factor Analysis on employee satisfaction and engagement data collected from THE DELL. The analysis will explore the underlying dimensions or factors that contribute to overall employee satisfaction and engagement within the organization.

Key Objectives:

Data Preparation:
Clean and preprocess the employee survey data.
Handle missing values appropriately.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of responses.
Factor Extraction:
Employ suitable methods (e.g., Principal Component Analysis, Maximum Likelihood) to extract the underlying factors.
Determine the optimal number of factors using appropriate criteria (e.g., Eigenvalue > 1, scree plot).
Factor Rotation:
Rotate the factors to improve interpretability (e.g., Varimax, Promax).
Factor Interpretation:
Assign meaningful labels to the extracted factors based on the loadings of the survey questions.
Analyze the relationships between the factors and employee demographics (if available).
Develop Insights:
Identify key drivers of employee satisfaction and engagement at THE DELL.
Understand the relative importance of different factors.
Generate actionable insights for improving employee morale and retention.
Expected Outcomes:

A set of identified factors that explain employee satisfaction and engagement at THE DELL.
A clear interpretation of each factor and its relationship to employee responses.
Recommendations for improving employee satisfaction and engagement based on the factor analysis findings.
Potential Challenges:

Data Quality: The quality of the survey data can significantly impact the accuracy and interpretability of the results.
Factor Interpretation: Assigning meaningful labels to the extracted factors can be subjective and may require expert judgment.
Sample Size and Representativeness: The analysis may be limited by the sample size and representativeness of the survey data.
Tools and Technologies:

Programming Languages: Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Statistical Software: R (with packages like psych, lavaan)
This project will provide valuable insights into the factors that influence employee satisfaction and engagement at THE DELL, enabling the organization to make data-driven decisions to improve its workplace culture and retain top talent.
